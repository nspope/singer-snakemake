"""
Calculate the number of mutations in a given AFS bin that arise within a given
time window, whilst (optionally) integrating over the position of a mutation on
a branch.  Optionally, AFS bins are down-projected to lower frequencies via
hypergeometric sampling, which can smooth results for smaller sequence lengths.
